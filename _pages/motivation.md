I have one single ultimate goal: become **the Galactic Emperor.**


Before dreaming of the Galactic Empire, I knew it would require seizing two things: power and a plan.

Power? That was easy.<br>
I awakened as an Undead in a silent graveyard under the pale moonlight of forgotten lands.
My past was a void. The only thing I felt — was that I had been Forsaken.<br>
Driven by that emptiness, I mastered the magic, walked among shadows, and commanded the fire.

But the plan? <br>
That’s where everything fell apart. <br>

Do I really look like a guy with a plan?<br>
I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it!

So I embrace the randomness — and let the dice decide.<br>
At every crossroad of destiny — **I roll.**

But make no mistake:<br>
When the Galactic Empire is forged, there will be no laws.  
No order.  
No treaties.  
No boring bureaucracies or councils.

There will be only **chaos** — pure, glorious chaos — and I shall reign at its heart.

**Taxes?**  
**Studies?**  
**Going to the office for work?**  
No!

We will wear our armor, mount our horses and ride into the nebulae.<br>
*“The Horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep, one last time!”*

Also, there won't be any headquarters.<br>
No thrones, no boardrooms.<br>
We will rule the galaxy from a **tavern**.

Be aware of that:<br>
Even the Empire will not give you freedom.<br>
Freedom begins only when you lose all hope.

Stop trying to control everything. Let go.<br>
Then you will begin to hear the distant echoes of drums of liberation.
