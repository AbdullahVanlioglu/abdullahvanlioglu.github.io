I have one single ultimate goal: become **the Galactic Emperor.**


Before dreaming of the Galactic Empire, I knew it would require seizing two core objectives: power and a comprehensive plan

The first part was cheap.  
When I have awaken as an Undead in a lovely graveyard in Tirisfal Glades, I wasn't aware anything about the world. 
But to gain power, I educated myself in Dark Magic, Shadows and Fire.

However, the second part — the plan — is the real struggle.

Do I really look like a guy with a plan? 
I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it!

So, lets leave fate to the dices.
In probabilistic manner, for every crossroad in my destiny — **I roll.**

But make no mistake.

When the Galactic Empire is forged, there will be no laws.  
No order.  
No treaties.  
No boring bureaucracies or galactic councils.

There will be only **chaos** — pure, glorious chaos — and I shall reign at its heart.

Taxes?, studies?, going to office for work? No!
We will wear our armor, mount our horses and and ride into the nebulae.

Also, there won't be any headquarters.
We will rule the galaxy from a tavern.
