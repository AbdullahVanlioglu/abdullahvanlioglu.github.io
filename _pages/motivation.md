I have one single ultimate goal: become **the Galactic Emperor.**


Before dreaming of the Galactic Empire, I knew it would require seizing two core objectives: power and a comprehensive plan.

The first part was cheap.  
When I awakened as an Undead in a lovely graveyard, I wasn't aware anything about the world.<br>
But to gain power, I educated myself in Magic, Shadows and Fire.

However, the second part — the plan — is the real struggle.<br>
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?<br>
I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it!

So, lets leave fate to the dices.<br>
In true probabilistic fashion, for every crossroad in my destiny — **I roll.**

But make no mistake:

When the Galactic Empire is forged, there will be no laws.  
No order.  
No treaties.  
No boring bureaucracies or galactic councils.

There will be only **chaos** — pure, glorious chaos — and I shall reign at its heart.

**Taxes?**  
**Studies?**  
**Going to the office for work?**  
No!

We will wear our armor, mount our horses and ride into the nebulae.

Also, there won't be any headquarters.<br>
We will rule the galaxy from a tavern.
