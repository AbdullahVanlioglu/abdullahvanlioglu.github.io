I hold a master’s degree from Istanbul Technical University (ITU) and worked as a researcher at the [Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Research Center](https://ai.itu.edu.tr/), under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Nazım Kemal Üre](http://kemalure.com). Currently, I am working as Lead Machine Learning Engineer at Beko Corporate. 

During my master's thesis, I focused on tackling cooperation challenges in multi-agent environments, particularly social dilemmas, through the use of **Deep Reinforcement Learning**. In addition to my work in Reinforcement Learning, I have explored various areas of interest such as **Sequence Modeling (RNNs, Transformers)**, and **Generative Models (LLMs, GANs & Diffusion Models)**. These explorations were aimed at effectively addressing the generalization and adaptation challenges in AI systems.

My research focuses broadly on **Generalist AI**, **Generative Models** and **Sequential Decision Making**. One of the significant challenges in AI research is the inefficiency of current algorithms relative to the learning abilities seen in humans and animals. Therefore, my goal is to advance AI agents capable of reasoning and long-term planning at a human-like level in complex environments/tasks.

Ultimate Goal:
Develop Imperialist AI Agents marching across the universe to build Galactic Empire again.
