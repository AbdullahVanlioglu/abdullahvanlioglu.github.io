I hold a master’s degree from Istanbul Technical University (ITU) and have worked as a researcher at the [Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Research Center](https://ai.itu.edu.tr/), under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Nazım Kemal Üre.

During my thesis, I focused on tackling cooperation challenges in multi-agent environments, particularly social dilemmas, through the use of **Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. In addition, I have collaborated with my colleagues in our lab to develop a generative model (GAN) that addresses **generalization challenges in RL**.

I have actively contributed to comprehensive repository utilizing the JAX framework. Furthermore, I have been actively involved in developing several research libraries written in the PyTorch framework, which have played an instrumental role in supporting our empirical studies.

My research interests encompass a broad range of topics within RL and its applications. While my current focus lies in fundamental RL, I am highly motivated to explore other exciting areas within Deep Learning and Generative AI as well. Currently, we are extending our previous work on incentivizing mechanism in multi-agent sequential social dilemmas to make it fully offline. Our goal is to develop a more practical and scalable solution that can be applied to real-world problems. Additionally, I possess a strong enthusiasm for enhancing and implementing mathematical methods in fundamental Deep Learning research.
