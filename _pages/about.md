I hold a master’s degree from Istanbul Technical University (ITU) and have worked as a researcher at the [Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Research Center](https://ai.itu.edu.tr/), under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Nazım Kemal Üre.

During my thesis, I focused on tackling cooperation challenges in multi-agent environments, particularly social dilemmas, through the use of **Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. In addition, I have collaborated with my colleagues in our lab to develop a generative model that addresses **generalization challenges in RL**. Our proposed model adjusts the difficulty of the environment by generating new environments that have a similar distribution to the training environment but are different enough to test the agent’s ability to generalize. 

I have actively contributed to comprehensive repository utilizing the JAX framework. Furthermore, I have been actively involved in developing several research libraries written in the PyTorch framework, which have played an instrumental role in supporting our empirical studies.

Currently, my research interests are centered around **Multi-Agent RL**, **Offline RL**, and **RL for robotics**. We are extending our previous work on incentivizing mechanism in multi-agent sequential social dilemmas to make it fully offline. Our goal is to develop a more practical and scalable solution that can be applied to real-world problems. Moreover, I am enthusiastically exploring the application of Offline Reinforcement Learning techniques to the field of robotics, aiming to enhance the performance of RL agents in real-world scenarios by enabling them to learn from offline data.
