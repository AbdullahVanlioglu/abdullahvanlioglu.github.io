I hold a master’s degree from Istanbul Technical University (ITU) and have worked as a researcher at the [Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Research Center](https://ai.itu.edu.tr/), under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Nazım Kemal Üre.

During my thesis, I focused on tackling cooperation challenges in multi-agent environments, particularly social dilemmas, through the use of **Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. In addition, I have collaborated with my colleagues in our lab to develop a generative model that addresses **generalization challenges in RL**.

I have actively contributed to comprehensive repository utilizing the JAX framework. Furthermore, I have been actively involved in developing several research libraries written in the PyTorch framework, which have played an instrumental role in supporting our empirical studies.

My research interests encompass a broad range of topics within RL and its applications. While my current focus lies in **fundamental RL**, **Multi-Agent RL**, **Offline RL**, and **RL for robotics**, I am highly motivated to explore other exciting areas within RL as well. Currently, we are extending our previous work on incentivizing mechanism in multi-agent sequential social dilemmas to make it fully offline. Our goal is to develop a more practical and scalable solution that can be applied to real-world problems. Moreover, I am eagerly exploring the application of Offline Reinforcement Learning techniques to the field of robotics, aiming to enhance the performance of RL agents in real-world scenarios by enabling them to learn from offline data.
