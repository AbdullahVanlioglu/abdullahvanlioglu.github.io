I hold a master’s degree from Istanbul Technical University (ITU) and worked as a researcher at the [Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Research Center](https://ai.itu.edu.tr/), under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Nazım Kemal Üre](http://kemalure.com). Currently, I am working as AI Research Engineer at Huawei. 

During my master's thesis, I focused on tackling cooperation challenges in multi-agent environments, particularly social dilemmas, through the use of **Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. In addition to my work in MARL, I have explored various areas of interest such as **Offline RL**, **Sequence Modeling (Transformers)**, and **Generative Models (LLMs, GAN & Diffusion Models)**. These explorations were aimed at effectively addressing the generalization and adaptation challenges in AI systems.

My research focuses broadly on **Generalist AI**, **Generative Models** and **Sequential Decision Making**. One of the significant challenges in AI research is the inefficiency of current algorithms relative to the learning abilities seen in humans and animals. Therefore, my goal is to advance AI agents capable of reasoning and long-term planning at a human-like level in complex environments/tasks.
