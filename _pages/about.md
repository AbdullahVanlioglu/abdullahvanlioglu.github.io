I hold a master’s degree from Istanbul Technical University (ITU) and have worked as a researcher at the [Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Research Center](https://ai.itu.edu.tr/), under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Nazım Kemal Üre.

During my thesis, I focused on tackling cooperation challenges in multi-agent environments, particularly social dilemmas, through the use of **Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. In addition, I have collaborated with my colleagues in our lab to develop a generative model (GAN) that addresses **generalization challenges in RL**.

My research interests encompass a broad range of topics within RL and its applications. While my current focus lies in fundamental RL, I am highly motivated to explore other exciting areas within Deep Learning and Optimization as well. Currently, I am working on the Offline RL and its challenge: distributional shift, which occurs when policy values are evaluated for state-action pairs that are out-of-distribution.
